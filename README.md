this is the final assignment for the SLP course "speech processing 2: acoustic modelling": cascade and parallel formant synthesis. the task was to:
- implement a standard cascade formant synthesizer using 5 discrete-time formant resonators connected in series
  and
- design and implement a formant synthesizer using 3 discrete-time formant resonators connected in parallel
the end goal being to generate vowel waveforms in the style of klatt (1979).
